                        Formerly known as Digital Telepathy, the company just did a rebrand into simply Telepathy. The company itself is a design agency that tends to focus more on the user-experience end of web design. So you will find that same general focus on their blog content, too. However, that shouldn’t deter you if you’re a generalist. The content is some of the best on the net, so you’d be doing yourself a disservice if you missed this one.
